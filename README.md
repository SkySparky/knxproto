## Documentation
So far there is no useful documentation other than the docstrings contained within the header files.
Maybe start with [src/routerclient.h](https://github.com/vapourismo/knxclient/blob/master/src/routerclient.h) or
[src/tunnelclient.h](https://github.com/vapourismo/knxclient/blob/master/src/tunnelclient.h).
