\subsection*{Usage}

The simplest way to get started is to clone the repository, generate the documentation and start reading.

\subsection*{Installation}

Obtain the source and navigate to its location. Run \begin{DoxyVerb}$ make
\end{DoxyVerb}


to build the library, followed by \begin{DoxyVerb}# make PREFIX=/path/to/prefix install
\end{DoxyVerb}


to install it. You can omit the {\ttfamily P\+R\+E\+F\+IX} variable, it defaults to {\ttfamily /usr/local}.

\subsection*{Contributing}

Since I have a very limited amount of K\+NX hardware to test against, I highly encourage you to test this library against the devices you own. Furthermore am I interested in how the software performs on different operating systems and also different C standard libraries.

\subsection*{Documentation}

A copy based on current state of the {\ttfamily master} branch can be found \href{http://vapourismo.github.io/knxproto/}{\tt here}.

You can also generate it yourself locally. \begin{DoxyVerb}$ make docs
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Development}

This library is still in pre-\/release state, you should expect the interface to change without notice.
